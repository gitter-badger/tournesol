# About the name

Tournesol is the french name of the crazy professor in [The Adventures of Tintin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin).
You may know him by the name of [Professor Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Calculus).
This name was chosen since this package turns [Lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab) into the home of a mad scientist.
