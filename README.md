# Tournesol
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vdeturckheim/tournesol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vdeturckheim/tournesol)

A Hapi-Glue-Lab-Code tool that could only be created by a crazy scientist.

# Purpose

This package aims at making api tests using Hapi, Lab and Code easier. The idea is to focus on what the tests mean rather than how to perform them.

# Usage

Please refer to [API reference](API.md)

# About the name

Tournesol is the french name of the crazy professor in [The Adventures of Tintin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin).
You may know him by the name of [Professor Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Calculus).
This name was chosen since this package turns [Lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab) into the home of a mad scientist.
